        "    One day, Jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in S.F.     ; she buys a pistol, follows him to a bar, lets him pick her up, then when they're alone in his Cadillac, beginning to make love, she shoots him....once in the genitals, once in the brain - - this in the opening scene!!     Ya gotta love this spunky lady.     She's got her priorities straight.     Plus, Jennifer is a professional artist, putting all her anger on canvas UNTIL NOW.     After executing her first perp, Jennifer curiously watches Det.     Insp.     Harry Callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the Caddy.     Then, she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street, visits her sister in a nursing home, then goes a'hunting in San Paolo, CA \"up the coast\" where the rape event took place years ago.     With more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind, our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall, as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist.     Not uncommon to us right- wingers, when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal, don't be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity, we REMEMBER the CRIME and the SUFFERING he inflicted.     Such recalled events steels Jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers - once in the genitals, once in the brain.     Throughout the movie, scenes of Jennifer's revenge are interspersed with good, IL' Dirty Harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop, remember \"Go ahead.     MAKE my day.\"?     Later on, he threatens to step on a punk kid (who'd just insulted Callahan) in a courthouse elevator like he'd step on dog- s**t....leaving a young female govt employee staring after Clint as if to say \"I want to have your baby.\"     My favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action, when Harry threatens and frightens a murderous Mafia boss named Threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter's wedding reception at the Mark Hopkins hotel.     Michael Grazzo (Pantangeli in Godfather II) does a wonderful job as the sinful Mafia Don, even if he's only in one scene, dying in a most-convincing manner.     However, Harry's troubles aren't over with yet!     The elevator punk's gang AND Threlkis' henchmen each attempt to assassinate Harry in two close-ordered scenes, and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly.     Yup, some of the gun-play comes off as uninspired screen violence....looking like Clint the Director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie.     But, there's only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets.     The punk kids die much more creatively, though, as they both burn to death and drown in S.F.     Bay.     Warms my heart.     With so much violent intent directed at Insp.     Callahan, his bosses send him to San Paolo to try to get some background on the \"22 caliber vasectomy killing\" as Jennifer Spencer's crime is now known, but not before Harry delivers one of his famous sermons-to-the- chowder-headed-liberals.     Love that Harry.     While our hero' up annoying the local cops and citizens in San Paolo, two more murders happen, same M.O., on a sleazy, lazy fisherman and on an equally-creepy hardware entrepreneur.     Then Harry meets Jennifer!     They find they both agree on subjects such as Law and Order, Making the Guilty Pay, etc.     Could a hot, love scene be in the offing soon?     We're led to believe just that.     Characters abound in this Real-Man meets Real-Woman crime drama, and we get to meet a brassy bull-dyke named Raye Parkins who's both irritating and entertaining.     Raye set up Jennifer's rape for her \"boyfriend\" years before, and she'll get hers eventually.     The San Paolo Police Chief, played by reliable Eastwood co-star Pat Hingle (the Hanging Judge in 'Hang Em High'), is strangely at odds with Callahan's detective work related to the 22-cal vasectomies, until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists.     Much like Jennifer's sister, Chief Janning's son is now a comatose adult, but driven mad by guilt.     It can't end here, though.     The dyke's rapist boyfriend, Mick, now a kinky-sex jerk of a criminal, drives in from Vegas becuz Raye's dropped a dime on Jennifer, summoning him up to San Paolo to prevent more executions.     Mick sleeps at Raye's house, but his timing is all wrong, and he's arrested before he can spend more time with Raye, mostly due to the fact that she's since been sent to the Island of the Eternal Lesboes by a shot from Jennifer's revolver.     Psycho Mick makes bail at long last, with Jennifer gunning for him.     A desperate chase ensues, as Harry tries to keep these two from killing each other.     It all turns out well in the end, with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful Roberta Flack blues song.\n",

        "    Peaches is a brave, bold and courageous departure.     For me it works on every level and I have now seen it twice.     Monahan is a filmmaker who is demonstrating great skill and incredible sensitivity.     For 'Auscrit' to make the comment that it is another TV movie etc and that Hugo Weaving is no good simply does not 'get' the film.     Or more particularly does not want to get it.     Frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both.     Or someone from inside the industry either distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy.     Your average punter, I have found just does not write comments like that.     I have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film Sommersault.     One has to wonder what people think they are looking at.     Unfortunately in Australia at the time SS was released the push was, if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you not the film.     This manipulation of the media is pretty common down under.     The reality is the only similarity between the two films are that they are rights of passage films.     Unfortunately for me SS is a film about nothing, that could have been told in 15 minutes.     I see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety.     Peaches in comparison is a master piece.     Personally I cannot wait to what Monahan does next as he is clearly way ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema.     In conclusion if the film does not win all at this years AFI's and IF awards, then it is a rigged game.     As for Auscrit, please find something more constructive do with your time\n",

        "    The story is phenomenal and so original, with Simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician Shurka takes over the power and killed the king.     Simon wants to go back and save the people, but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape.     Simon befriends lone warrior Kor (the usually cool dude Bo Svenson who clearly needed the pay check), who assists Simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals, dangerous encounters and magical showdowns.     Admittedly it doesn't even sound too bad thus far, but that's merely just because I excluded all the deliciously inept little details.     Simon has a best friend named Gulfax, for example.     Gulfax is an albino version of Chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodle-snout to yelp something incomprehensible.     The obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the \"plot\" and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content.     Simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph, Kor settles an old score with the pig-faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there's the supposedly horrible 'suicide cave' where you can only sing your way out of.     But the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence \u0096 not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema \u0096 involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors.     Simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors, hoping they will assist them in their battle, but the rotting corpses only take a few steps, complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves.     That's it!     So much for the zombie sub plot!     Best sequence ever!     I could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs, but you get the idea.     \"Wizards of the Lost Kingdom\" is a tremendously messed-up \"so-bad-it's-good\" film.     Word of advice: do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone.     Invite friends, preferably the dope-headed types with a wicked sense of humor, and watch it in group.     It will be a night to remember\u0085",
