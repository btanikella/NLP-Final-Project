    The barbarians maybes not the best film that anybody of us have seen, but really???
    ?........Its so funny......I cant discribe how mutch I laughed when I first saw it..The director really wanted to do a serious adventure movie, but itsso misirable bad....so bad that its one of the funniest movies Ive ever seen......so my advise is that you should see it.....and if you alredy did, se it again!!!!!!
